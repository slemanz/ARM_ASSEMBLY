# Load-Store Instructions

ARM uses load-store instructions, like LDR (load) and STR (store), to move data
between memory and registers. 

## Bit size

Bit size allows the CPU to address memory for an individual process.

X-bit can handle $2^X$ bytes of memory.

The higher the bit size, the higher performance.
