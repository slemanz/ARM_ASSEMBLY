# Constants and Literal Pools

In ARM assembly, constants are immediate values or symbolic definitions used
directly in instructions or as fixed values. Literal pools are a mechanism used
by the assembler to store constant data (especially large or arbitrary 32-bit
values and addresses) in a memory area within the code section, from which they
can be loaded into registers using PC-relative LDR instructions.
